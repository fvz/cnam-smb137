 o errno + print

 o alias
    - Add some default alias in executing mysh
    - Ability to set an alias to empty : it remove it

 o Parsers (cmdoper, cmdredir, cmdargs)
    - do no store the '\' char : use a temporary buffer

 o builtin_cmd
    - builtin_cmd_echo : rewrite with only one printf.
        For better perf, we can build the string in a buffer and print
        on the stdin by using 'printf' only one time.

 o history :
	- Use Arrow keys for navigate in history

 o command line :
    - replace '~' by the homedir of current user.
